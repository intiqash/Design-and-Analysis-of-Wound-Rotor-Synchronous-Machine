# Design-and-Analysis-of-Wound-Rotor-Synchronous-Machine
The project involved optimizing brushless wound rotor synchronous machines (BL-WRSM) for enhanced performance.
Data collected from JMAG simulations was processed using Python libraries to handle large datasets efficiently.
Visualization of results was performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn, allowing for better interpretation of the outcomes.
As an Engineer, my responsibilities included analyzing performance data and optimizing parameters.
